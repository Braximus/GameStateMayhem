 - An Asteroids clone.
 - Destroy all asteroids to win.
 - Avoid contact with asteroids.
 - If you get struck by an asteroid, you loose
  a life and shield goes online.
 - When you loose all lives, the game ends.
 - While shield is online, you can't shoot,
  but you also you can't be hit.
 - The shield will go down after 5 seconds.
 Use that time to make a distance
  between you and asteroids.
 - Use W,S,A and D for movement in 
 desired direction.
 - Use Mouse to aim and left mouse button
  to shoot.
 - Escape button will bring the pause menu.
 - Have fun! :)
